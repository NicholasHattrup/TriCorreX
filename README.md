Any practioner and/or enthasuasist of molecular dynamics has likely come across the radial distrubtion function (RDF). The RDF is a simple yet robust way to characterize a system: compares the configuration of a particles local enviroment to their configuration in a perfect gas. In a perfect gas the particles behave at random and show no perference in regards to distance seperation. But for interacting particles, if the potential in use provides attractive distances, those distances will find on average higher particle counts, like below for the classic Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid.

This is the perferred 2-body seperation distrubtion at $\rho^{*}=0.45$ and $T^{ *}=1.0$.
